In order to run test suite 32-33, three test classes, OsafNtfCmTestRT,
OsafNtfCmTestRT1 and OsafNtfCmTestCFG must be loaded in IMM. In the UML
environment these classes are loaded by the test suite provided that the
ntfsv_test_classes.xml has been put in the
tools/cluster_sim_uml/repl-opensaf directory. If the test suite doesn't load
the classes, then update IMM manually with 'immcfg -f ntfsv_test_classes.xml'.

Classes OsafNtfCmTestRT and OsafNtfCmTestCFG are used in test suite 32.
Test suite 33 and class OsafNtfCmTestRT1 is used for runtime persistency
testing (PBE).


A few things must be done in order to activate PBE:

(1) configure the build with --enable-imm-pbe flag (configure --enable-imm-pbe)

(2) edit the osaf/services/saf/immsv/config/immnd.conf file.
uncomment the three environment variables IMMSV_ROOT_DIRECTORY, IMMSV_LOAD_FILE
and IMMSV_PBE_FILE.

Test suite 33 then activates pbe (immcfg -a saImmRepositoryInit=1 safRdn=
immManagement,safApp=safImmService) itself, which can be verified by looking for
daemon 'immpbed' on one of the controller nodes.
