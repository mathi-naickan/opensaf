In order to run test suites 32 and 34, a number of test classes must be loaded.
in IMM. In the UML environment these classes are loaded by the test suite
provided that the ntfsv_test_classes.xml has been put in the
tools/cluster_sim_uml/repl-opensaf directory. If the test suite doesn't load
the classes, then update IMM manually with 'immcfg -f ntfsv_test_classes.xml'.

A few things must be done in order to activate PBE:

(1) configure the build with --enable-imm-pbe flag (configure --enable-imm-pbe)

(2) edit the osaf/services/saf/immsv/config/immnd.conf file.
uncomment the three environment variables IMMSV_ROOT_DIRECTORY, IMMSV_LOAD_FILE
and IMMSV_PBE_FILE.

(3) activate pbe, immcfg -a saImmRepositoryInit=1 safRdn=
immManagement,safApp=safImmService

The test suite 35 has been added for the test of create/modify/delete object
having extended name attribute (#873). This test suite also requires the 
ntfsv_test_classes.xml loaded, and extended name must be enabled in IMM by
following steps:
- Enable SA_ENABLE_EXTENDED_NAMES=1 in immnd.conf
- immcfg -m -a longDnsAllowed=1 opensafImm=opensafImm,safApp=safImmService
