1. General

This directory tree contains a unit test suite for IMM A.02.01. The goal is to
test the API extensively. Checking all possible error conditions etc.

The test suite is not distributed but can of course be run on every node in
the system which kind of makes it distributed.

The IMM test suite uses the unit test framework in OpenSAF (tests/unit_test_fw).

There are two independent suites for management and implementer respectively.


2. Building and installing

The two programs immomtest and immoitest are built by OpenSAF's normal make 
system. They are either installed using 'make install' or packaged in the tools
rpm. They will be in the path after installation.


3. Running the test suite.

3.1 General

A specific test suite or test case can be run. Just give the numerical value 
for the suite and/or test case as arguments to the binary.

Examples from the UML Environment:
# /hostfs/immomtest
# /hostfs/immomtest 3
# /hostfs/immomtest 4 2
# /hostfs/immoitest
# /hostfs/immoitest 3
# /hostfs/immoitest 4 2

The result is printed to stdout. Each test case represents one line. At the 
end a result summary is printed.

To enable debug printouts from the test cases set the variable TESTDEBUG
to '1' before starting the suite:

# export TESTDEBUG=1


4. Adding a new test suite/case

TBD.
