1) Option `-f` (#1315)
-------------------------------------------------

Option `-f` is only applicable for application streams. Means it is only valid
with option `-a`. If the option `-f` is not provided, default behavior is
maintained.

Why the option `-f` needed?

Long app stream name is now supported (#1315), user is able to put long stream
name after option `-a`.  With original behavior, saflogger tool would use that
long app stream name for log file name.  In that case, the log file name would
be over 256 characters in length. Logsv might get failed to create such a long
file name (Most Unix system supports file name length up to 255 characters).
