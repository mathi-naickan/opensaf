High Level Implementation Notes for LOCK and SHUTDOWN operation on NG: 
===========================================================

In 2N model, there are broadly two cases for LOCK and SHUTDOWN operation on NG:
A) Whole 2N SG is mapped in NG which means all assigned SU are hosted on the 
   nodes of NG. Or
B) SG is partially mapped in NG i.e either active SU or standby SU is hosted 
   on one of the nodes of NG. 

Currently 2N model supports SI dep with in SU. So in LOCK and SHUTDOWN operations 
quiesced and quiescing HA states, should be given honoring SI deps respectively.
In case A), AVD_SG_FSM_SG_ADMIN is used in case A) as it honors si dep while 
giving quiesced or quiescing assignments.
Case B) becomes the case of either lock of standby Node/SU or active
Node/Su which still needs to be handled honoring SI dep. Here AVD_SG_FSM_SU_OPER fsm
state is used via internal function su_admin_down() as it handles SI dep.
So in 2N model, AMFD always uses internal FSM functions by calling
them inside the wrapper function ng_admin().

Other red models do not support SI deps within SU as of now. So in these 
models, AMFD uses AVD_SG_FSM_SG_REALIGN by keeping multiple SUs in operation
list while performing LOCK and SHUTDOWN operation on NG. Once SI dep is fully 
supported in these modles, AMFD can use internal SG FSM state like 2N.

However there is one case, where AMFD can still use AVD_SG_FSM_SG_ADMIN 
state for these red models when whole SG is mapped in NG (all assigned 
SUs are hosted on on the nodes of NG). But possibility of such a case 
is more in 2N model where only two SUs can be assigned anytime. In other 
red models, there can be many assigned SUs so possibility of whole SG is 
mapped in NG is very less. So, as of now, in other models AVD_SG_FSM_SG_REALIGN
states is used by keeping multiple SUs in oper list for this case also. 
But when SI deps, is completely supported with in SU in these models, 
then AMFD cannot use realign state and it will have to use internal FSM code 
as it will be enhanced for that.
