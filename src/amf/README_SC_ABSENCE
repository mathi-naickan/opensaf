GENERAL
-------

This is a description of how the AMF service suppports the SC absence feature 
which allows payloads to remain running during the absence of both SCs, and 
perform recovery after at least one SC comes back. 

CONFIGURATION
-------------

AMF reads the "scAbsenceAllowed" attribute to determine if SC absence feature 
is enabled. A positive integer indicates the number of seconds AMF will 
tolerate the absence period of both SCs, and a zero value indicates this 
feature is disabled.

Normally, the AMF Node Director (amfnd) will restart a node if there is no 
active AMF Director (amfd). If this feature is enabled, the Node Director will
delay the restart for the duration specified in "scAbsenceAllowed". If a SC
returns during the period, the restart is aborted.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
----------------------

* Amfnd detects absence of SCs:
Upon receiving NCSMDS_DOWN event which indicates the last active SC has gone,
amfnd will not reboot the node and enters SC absence period (if 
scAbsenceAllowed is configured)

* Escalation and Recovery during SC absence period:
Restarts will work as normal, but failover or switchover will result in Node
Failfast. The repair action will be initiated when a SC returns if 
saAmfSGAutoRepair is enabled.

* Amfnd detects return of SCs:
NCSMDS_UP is the event that amfnd uses to detect the presence of an active amfd.

* New sync messages 
New messages (state information messages) have been introduced to carry 
assignments and states from all amfnd(s), which then are sent to amfd. State 
information messages also contain component and SU restart counts. These new 
counter values will be updated to IMM after recovery.The operation where 
amfnd(s) sends state information messages and amfd processes these messages
is known as a *sync* operation.

* Admin operation continuation
If an admin operation on an AMF entity is still in progress when the cluster 
loses both SCs, the operation will continue when a SC returns. In order to 
resume the admin operation, AMF internal states that are used in the admin 
operation need to be restored. In a normal cluster state, these states are
*regularly* checkpointed to the standby AMFD so that the standby AMFD can 
take over the active role if the active AMFD goes down. Using a similar 
approach, new AMF runtime cached attributes are introduced to store the states 
in IMM, as another method of restoring these states for the purpose of SC 
absence recovery. The new attributes are:
- osafAmfSISUFsmState:SUSI fsm state 
- osafAmfSGFsmState:SG fsm state
- osafAmfSGSuOperationList:SU operation list of SG
- osafAmfSUSwitch:SU switch toggle.

Only 2N SG is currently supported for admin operation continuation.

LIMITATIONS
-----------

* While both SCs are absent, any failover or switchover escalation will result 
in node failfast. The events of node reboot, node power off, and node failfast
will lead to a loss of SI assignments, which are not restored during the SC 
absence period. The SI assignments may remain in improper states until a SC 
comes back. Recovery of any lost SI assignments during SC absence period is 
currently not supported.

* SI dependency tolerance timer 
After a SC comes back, if an unassigned sponsor SI is detected, all its 
dependent SI(s) assignments are removed regardless of tolerance duration. The 
time of sponsor SI becoming unassigned is not recorded, so the new amfd cannot
figure out how much time is left that the dependent SI(s) can tolerate.

* Proxy and Proxied components are not yet supported

* Alarms and notifications
During the SC absence period, notifications will not be sent as the Director in
charge of sending notifications is not available. For example, if a component 
fails to instantiate while SC absence stage and its SU becomes disabled, a state
change for the SU from ENABLED to DISABLED will not be sent.

List of possible missed notifications
=====================================
SA_AMF_PRESENCE_STATE of a SU
SA_AMF_OP_STATE of a SU 
SA_AMF_HA_STATE of a SI 
SA_AMF_ASSIGNMENT_STATE of a SI

After the SC absence period, some redundant alarms and notifications may be sent
from the Director. Initially the Director will think all PLs are down. But as 
sync info is received from PLs, alarms will be cleared or set, and finally reflect
the current state of the cluster. For example, an alarm may initially be raised
for an unassigned SI, but later cleared as the Director learns of the SI assignment
 on a PL that remained running.

Redundant notifications
=======================
SA_AMF_PRESENCE_STATE of a SU may change from SA_AMF_PRESENCE_UNINSTANTIATED to <<current state>>
SA_AMF_OP_STATE of a SU may change from SA_AMF_OPERATIONAL_DISABLED to <<current state>>
SA_AMF_HA_STATE of a SI may change from "" to <<current state>>
SA_AMF_ASSIGNMENT_STATE of a SI may change from SA_AMF_ASSIGNMENT_UNASSIGNED to <<current state>>

Redundant alarms
================
An unassigned SI alarm may be raised and then cleared shortly afterwards

Furthermore, some notifications may be slightly misleading. For example, if a SI
becomes PARTIALLY_ASSIGNED from FULLY_ASSIGNED because a component develops a fault
while SC absence period, the SI change notification may describe the SI going from
UNASSIGNED to PARTIALLY_ASSIGNED. This is because the Director initially does not 
know about the existence of the SIs assigned to PLs that remained running.

Limited notifications
=====================
SA_AMF_ASSIGNMENT_STATE of a SI may change from SA_AMF_ASSIGNMENT_UNASSIGNED to 
SA_AMF_ASSIGNMENT_PARTIALLY_ASSIGNED when it should be 
SA_AMF_ASSIGNMENT_FULLY_ASSIGNED to SA_AMF_ASSIGNMENT_PARTIALLY_ASSIGNED

* Some AMF API functions will be unavailable while SC absence period
saAmfProtectionGroupTrack() and saAmfProtectionGroupTrackStop() return 
SA_AMF_ERROR_TRY_AGAIN.

* One payload limitation

If the cluster is configured with one payload without PBE, IMM will reload from
XML the second time the cluster experiences the absence of both SCs. This causes
amfd to lose all objects which were created before SC absence and data 
inconsistency will occur between amfnd and amfd/IMM on the SC. To avoid this 
inconsistency, the payload will be rebooted.
