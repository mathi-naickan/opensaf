This is the README file for the PLMc daemon directory.

This directory consists of the following files:

Makefile
  A simple Makefile for making the PLMc daemon and test programs.
  It includes the targets: all, clean.
  Note: This Makefile does not provide an install target, as
  the installation should be provided when PLMc is integrated
  with an OpenSAF source repository. For manual installation, see
  the note in the main README file in the above directory.

  Also note: The plmcd daemon is built with DEBUG messages turned off:
    CFLAGS=-Wall -fpic

  If you want to turn on debug messages, use:
    CFLAGS=-Wall -fpic -DPLMC_DEBUG
  Additional debug messages will show up in syslog and STDOUT.

  It is recommended that if you are running plmcd for the first time,
  that you compile with PLMC_DEBUG turned turned on so that you can see
  additional informational output on STDOUT, and in /var/log/messages.
  Later, when you are familiar with the operation of plmcd, you can
  recompile the daemon with PLMC_DEBUG turned off.

plmcd.c
  The source code for the plmcd daemon program.

plmc_read_config.c
  The source code for the PLMc function: plmc_read_config().

plmc_get_listening_ip_addr.c
  The source code for the PLMc function: plmc_get_listening_ip_addr(); 
  This function looks at the available network interfaces and selects
  the correct one to use for the tcp and udp listening threads.

plmc_cmd_string_to_enum.c
  The source code for the PLMc function: plmc_cmd_string_to_enum()
  which converts the string version of a PLMc command to an enum value. 

plmc_tcp_talker.c
  A test program that allows a user to interactively exercise the
  PLMc daemon without using the PLMc library.  Note: The 
  plmc_tcp_talker program is limited to connecting to one PLMc
  daemon at a time.  This program is good for testing one
  connection to the PLMc daemon, and does not use the PLMc
  library to exercise the daemon.  However, if you want to test
  the PLMc library, use the test/test_lib program instead - which
  allows connections to multiple PLMc daemons.  Also note: Do not run
  the plmc_tcp_talker and test_lib at the same time - as they
  both connect to the PLMc daemon on the same port number.  

plmc_udp_listener.c
  A test program that listens for PLMc UPD messages.
