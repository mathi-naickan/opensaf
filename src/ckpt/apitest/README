1. General

This directory tree contains a unit test suite for CKPT B.02.02. The goal is to
test the API extensively. Checking all possible error conditions etc.

The test suite is not distributed but can of course be run on every node in
the system which kind of makes it distributed.

The CKPT test suite uses the unit test framework in OpenSAF (tests/unit_test_fw).


2. Building and installing

The program cpsvtest is built by OpenSAF's normal make system. They are either 
installed using 'make install' or packaged in the tools rpm. They will be in 
the path after installation.


3. Running the test suite.

3.1 General

A specific test suite or test case can be run. Just give the numerical value 
for the suite and/or test case as arguments to the binary.

Examples from the UML Environment:
# /hostfs/cpsvtest
# /hostfs/cpsvtest 3
# /hostfs/cpsvtest 4 2

The result is printed to stdout. Each test case represents one line. At the 
end a result summary is printed.

To enable full printouts from the test cases uncomment the following line in 
the Makefile.am

#cpsvtest_CPPFLAGS += -DFULL_LOG 

4. Adding a new test suite/case

Each test case is implemented in a function in test_cpa.c file. To add a new 
test case, a new function for new test case should be defined. Then, it should
be included in the test case list below in same file.

__attribute__ ((constructor)) static void ckpt_cpa_test_constructor(void) {
