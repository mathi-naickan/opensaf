The OpenSAF Campaign and ETF schema files are modified for the following reasons:

SAI-AIS-SMF-ETF-A.01.02_OpenSAF.xsd 
------------------------------------------------------
1) Allows software bundles without entity types.
   This will make it possible to e.g. deliver OS-type SW which has no 
   component representation in IMM.

SAI-AIS-SMF-UCS-A.01.02_OpenSAF.xsd
------------------------------------------------------
1) Works with simpler XML editors which do not support the {name} rule.
2) No targetEntity needed in the campaign. This allows e.g. installation 
   of SW without changing any attributes in Comp/SU objects. Suitable for
   OS-type software upgrade which has no Comp/SU representation in IMM.
3) The schema is modified by defining 'unique' tag for object creation/modification
   in the following sections of the schema:
   - amfentitytypes
   - immCCB
   - modifyOperation
   - activationUnit added

Detailed information is found in the beginning of each file.
