OpenSAF 4.7.0 (released 2015-11-01)
-----------------------------------

This is a major release containing new enhancements. Before installing or
upgrading to OpenSAF 4.7, make sure your system meets the minimum version
requirements of the following system components:

- Linux kernel, version 2.6.32 or later (see note below regarding TIPC, though)
- GNU C Library (Glibc), version 2.11 or later
- GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), version 4.8.1 or later
- Libxml2, version 2.7 or later
- Libsqlite3, version 3.6 or later (only needed when configuring with
  --enable-imm-pbe)

Pay special attention to the fact that we have increased the minimum required
version of GCC to 4.8.1 in OpenSAF 4.7, due to the use of the C++11 standard.

When using MDS over TIPC, note that starting with OpenSAF 4.5, the TIPC
multi-cast feature is being used. Due to TIPC bugs present in old versions of
the Linux kernel, please make sure to use Linux kernel version 3.16 or later, or
alternatively make sure that the relevant TIPC bug-fixes have been back-ported
to the Linux kernel version you are using.
