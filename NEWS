OpenSAF 5.1.0 (released 2016-09-27)
-----------------------------------

This is a major release containing new enhancements. Before installing or
upgrading to OpenSAF 5.1, make sure your system meets the minimum version
requirements of the following system components:

- Linux kernel, version 2.6.37 or later. Recommended version is Linux 3.18 or
  later when using the TCP transport, and Linux 4.4.22 or later when using the
  TIPC transport. Linux versions older than the recommended ones contain bugs
  that are known to affect the proper function of OpenSAF. Use of Linux versions
  older than the recommended ones together with OpenSAF is strongly discouraged.
- GNU C Library (Glibc), version 2.11 or later
- GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), version 4.8.1 or later
- Libxml2, version 2.7 or later
- Libsqlite3, version 3.6 or later (only needed when configuring with
  --enable-imm-pbe)
- OpenHPI, version 2.17.0 or later (only needed when configuring with
  --enable-ais-plm)
- Libvirt, version 0.9.7 or later (only needed when configuring with
  --enable-ais-plm)

Pay special attention to the fact that we have increased the minimum required
version of GCC to 4.8.1 in OpenSAF 4.7.0, due to the use of the C++11 standard.
In OpenSAF 4.7.2, the minimum Linux version was increased to 2.6.37.
