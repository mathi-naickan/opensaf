OpenSAF 4.5.0 (released 2014-10-07)
-----------------------------------

This is an enhancements release. Before installing or upgrading to OpenSAF
4.5.0, make sure your system has the minimum version of some system components:

- Linux kernel, version 2.6.32 or later (see note below regarding TIPC, though)
- GNU C Library (Glibc), version 2.11 or later
- GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), version 4.3 or later
- Libxml2, version 2.7 or later
- Libsqlite3, version 3.6 or later (only needed when configuring with
  --enable-imm-pbe)

When using MDS over TIPC, note that starting with this release of OpenSAF, the
TIPC multicast feature is being used. Due to TIPC bugs present in old versions
of the Linux kernel, please make sure to use Linux kernel version 3.16 or later,
or alternatively make sure that the relevant TIPC bug-fixes have been backported
to the Linux kernel version you are using.

New configration attributes have been added to the class OpensafImm in OpenSAF
4.5, which means that the class schema has to be updated when upgrading from an
older release of OpenSAF. An imm xml file containing the extended class
definition for OpensafImm has been added at
samples/immsv/OpensafImm_Upgrade_4.5.xml
