Configuring OpenSAF
===================
NOTE: Upon installation of OpenSAF(through 'make install' or rpm install),
the $pkgsysconfdir/osafdir.conf (e.g. /etc/opensaf/osafdir.conf) shall contain
definitions of the directory paths where the OpenSAF packages are installed.

OpenSAF configuration files are located in the $pkgsysconfdir (e.g. /etc/opensaf)
directory. 

Following is the brief description of each of the configuration files.

a) nodeinit.conf:
This is the input file to the Node Initialization Daemon for serializing the
opensaf services startup.

NOTE: The interface name and network id arguments to the nid_tipc entry
in nodeinit.conf would get installed with default values. Please change this
accordingly to reflect your correct interface(s) and network-id information.

Example 1, single interface:
/usr/lib/opensaf/nid_tipc:TIPC:S:/usr/lib/opensaf/nid_tipc:4000::2:1:start eth0 1234:stop

Example 2, dual interfaces:
/usr/lib/opensaf/nid_tipc:TIPC:S:/usr/lib/opensaf/nid_tipc:4000::2:1:start eth0,eth1 1234:stop

In the above line, eth0 and eth1 refers to the interface information and 1234 
refers to a sample tipc network id. Please change them accordingly. This
tipc-network id should be the same across all system controllers and payloads
in that OpenSAF cluster. The Ethernet interfaces is a comma separated list as
shown in the example 2 or just the name of a single interface as in
example 1.

Please note that OpenSAF recommend users to run TIPC on two separate bearers
and let TIPC do the link aggregation. A bonded interface is not recommended.

Also see http://tipc.sourceforge.net/doc/tipc_2.0_users_guide.html

By default `make install' will install pre-configured for a controller node.
i.e. By default, `nodeinit.conf' is a softlink to nodeinit.conf.controller file.
On a payload node, the nodeinit.conf must be a softlink to
nodeinit.conf.payload upon a 'make install'. For e.g.:

    % cd $pkgsysconfdir (e.g. /etc/opensaf/)
    % ln -sf nodeinit.conf.payload nodeinit.conf

b) slot_id:
The slot_id shall specify a unique value that represents a physical slot
identifier for the node in a chassis environment. The same applies for a
simulation environment on a PC.

c) subslot_id:
The subslot_id shall specify a unique value that represents a physical sub-slot
identifier for the node in a chassis environment. The same applies for a
simulation environment on a PC.

d) chassis_id: 
The chassis_id represents an identifier for the chassis (Distributed Computing
Environment) and should be set to an integer value. The same applies for a
simulation environment on a PC.

e) imm.xml:
This file contains the OpenSAF Information Model. This file is installed
in the $pkgimmxmldir (e.g. /usr/share/opensaf/immxml/ directory).
It contains the classes and configuration objects information of 
all OpenSAF services: IMM, PLM, CLM, AMF, LOG, NTF, DTS.

By default based on the configuration options chosen, i.e. whether
a particular service is enabled or not, the imm.xml files of individual OpenSAF 
service are installed in $pkgimmxmldir 
(e.g. /usr/local/share/opensaf/immxml/services) directory.

Perform the following steps to generate the final/combined imm.xml. (Also
refer to the readme in $pkgimmxmldir (e.g. /usr/share/opensaf/immxml/) directory.

% cd $(pkgimmxmldir) 
# To generate a config file (nodes.cfg) for a 5 node cluster, 
do the following commands
% immxml-clustersize -s 2 -p 3

This step shall generate the nodes.cfg file that contains the 
node names for the cluster nodes.

User can edit these node names of choice for generating the final imm.xml.
For eg:- The default values can be replaced with the hostnames of the
cluster nodes.

# generate the imm.xml
% immxml-configure

# copy the generated imm.xml file to the standard OpenSAF configuration directory.
For eg:-
% cp imm.xml.20100217_2201 /etc/opensaf/imm.xml

f) node_name:
The node_name file contains the RDN value of the CLM node name. By default,
the node_name shall contain the hostname (output of the command 'hostname -s').
User can change the default value but the changed value 'must match' with
the value specified in the nodes.cfg that was used to generate the imm.xml.
i.e. the node_name value should match the value present in the generated imm.xml.
 
g) Location of tipc.ko:
The location of the tipc.ko shall be specified through the TIPC_MODULE variable in
the /usr/lib/opensaf/nid_tipc ($pkglibdir/nid_tipc) file.

h) /etc/plmcd.conf
The plmcd.conf file has to be edited as below 'when PLM is enabled'.

The following entries have to be modified accordingly:

[ee_id]
0020f

The ee_id field should contain the DN name of the EE hosting the OpenSAF controller
as specified by the SaPlmEE object.

For eg:-
IF the DN name of the EE object in the imm.xml is set to
...        <object class="SaPlmEE">
...                <dn>safEE=SC-1,safDomain=domain_1</dn>

THEN, the [ee_id] field should be set to 
[ee_id]
safEE=SC-1,safDomain=domain_1

Note: Here SC-1 is the default value specified in the nodes.cfg file while generating
the imm.xml

[controller_1_ip]
10.105.1.3

[controller_2_ip]
10.105.1.6

The controller_1_ip and controller_2_ip fields shall contain the IP Addresses
of the peer controllers.

[os_type]
This is a description of the OS. Currently it needs to follow 
# the following syntax, 1;os;Fedora;2.6.31, where 
# 1 => Version
# os => Product
# Fedora => Vendor
# 2.6.31 => Release
# Note that Version is mandatory while the other fields can be empty

The [os_type] field should match with the values contained
in the imm.xml for that EE.
It shall contain the attribute values of the SaPlmEEBaseType 
and SaPlmEEType objects, each separated by Semi-Colons.

For eg:-
IF The following is the version of the EE in the default imm.xml,
        <object class="SaPlmEEType">
                <dn>safVersion=1,safEEType=Linux_os</dn>

AND, the following is configured in the default imm.xml,

        <object class="SaPlmEEBaseType">
                <dn>safEEType=Linux_os</dn>
                <attr>
                        <name>saPlmEetProduct</name>
                        <value>os</value>
                </attr>
                <attr>
                        <name>saPlmEetVendor</name>
                        <value>SUSE</value>
                </attr>
                <attr>
                        <name>saPlmEetRelease</name>
                        <value>2.6</value>
                </attr>
        </object>

THEN, the [os_type] field shall be set to the following value:
[os_type]
1;os;SUSE;2.6

Using the IMMXML Merge Tool:
===========================
% cd  $pkgimmxmldir (e.g. cd /usr/share/opensaf/immxml/)
% ./immxml-merge $pkgsysconfdir/imm.xml my.xml > merged.xml

(e.g. ./immxml-merge /etc/opensaf/imm.xml my.xml > merged.xml )
