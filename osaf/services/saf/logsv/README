GENERAL

This directory (logsv) contains an implementation of the SAF LOG service
version A.02.01.

The LOG service is implemented as a server process executing on the controllers
using a 2N redundancy model. Message based check pointing is
used to synchronize the two server instances.

The Log file property "High Availability flag" is not supported by LOG itself
but by using a replicated file system. The LOG implementation is unaware of 
such a file system and must be configured to use it, see below.


DEPENDENCIES

logsv depends of the following other OpenSAF services:
- MBCSV
- MDS
- BASE
- logtrace

DATA STRUCTURES

lgs uses the following data structures:

- Control block. Statically allocated, one instance. Access through a global
pointer variable.

- Stream descriptors. Dynamically created, many instances. Accessed using
stream name or ID. Stored in patricia tree and array.

- Client descriptors. Dynamically created, many instances. Accessed using a
client ID. Stored in patricia tree. Contains the MDS address of the client.
Also contains a list of Client-Stream association objects, see below.

- Client-Stream association object. Dynamically created, many instances. One
instance per open stream. Contains a stream ID. Access through client
descriptor.

lga uses the following data structures:

- Control block. Statically allocated, one instance per library. Access
through a global variable. The control block contains the head of a linked
list with client descriptors.

- Client descriptor. Dynamically allocated. One instance per call to
saLogInitialize(). Contains callback pointers, handles and the head of a
linked list with streams descriptors for this client.

- Stream descriptor. Dynamically allocated. One instance per call to
saLogStreamOpen_2() or saLogStreamOpenAsync_2(). Contains internals IDs
and handles.


OVERLOAD PROTECTION

LOG uses a single mailbox used to communicate from the MDS thread to the
main thread. An IPC mailbox has four priority levels. By default a level
is unbounded in size, as many messages as the main memory allows can be
queued. The mailbox provides a mechanism to put a a limit on how many
messages that can be stored at the same time in it. LOG overload uses
that feature.

The highest level is used for control messages except for FINALIZE & CLOSE
messages. The reason is that we want to keep those at the same priority as
WRITE messages so that no writes will get discarded when a stream is closed
or a client finalize the API. The three other mailbox priority levels are
used for WRITE messages per stream type. Alarm use the next level, System
and Notification share the next level and all application streams share the
lowest priority level. The alarm level can never be bounded in size.

The levels used for system and application streams has an optional
configurable LOW and HIGH limit of queued messages. When the high limit
is hit, the level enters the FULL state. This state will not be left 
until the number of messages goes below the LOW limit. Messages received
in the meantime will be nacked with a TRYAGAIN, but only if the client has
requested so in the log record header. Otherwise it will be silently
discarded (but counted as such). CLOSE & FINALIZE messages will never be
rejected even though the level is full. If that happens, the message is
queued at the (unlimited) control message level.

Log records will be handled by the LOG server in the same priority.
All Alarm log records will be written to disk before any System/notification
log records. All System/notification log records will be written to disk
before any application log records are written to disk. This reduces the
risk to loose any important system events at sudden failure such as power
outage.

The low/high limits for system and app streams are configurable. See the
next section. Different app streams share the same limits.


CONFIGURATION

The LOG specification describes the configuration object class 
SaLogStreamConfig which requires the three streams alarm, notification and 
system to exist (in IMM). The two LOG classes and objects for the three
default streams are included in the OpenSAF IMM configuration. There is also a
configuration object class OpenSafLogConfig used to configure the LOG Service
itself. This class is not described in the LOG specification.

Some implementation defined configuration can be done for the LOG service.
Two ways of handling configuration is supported.

1. Configuration using a configuration object in IMM:
----------------------------------------------------
When the LOG service is started it looks for a configuration object of 
OpenSafLogConfig class. If an object is found and is correct the parameters in the
object will be used. The configuration file as described in section 2 will not
be used except according to 3. below. The parameters in the object corresponds with the parameters described
in section 2. All parameters has a default value that is defined in the class
definition. By default an object of this class is created with the object name
"logConfig=1,safApp=safLogService" and no other attributes are set,
meaning that all parameters will get their default value.

The class defines the following parameters (logsv_classes.xml):

NAME                        DEFAULT VALUE
saLogRootDirectory          /var/log/opensaf/saflog
saLogMaxLogrecsize          1024
saLogStreamSystemHighLimit  0
saLogStreamSystemLowLimit   0
saLogAppHighLimit           0
saLogAppLowLimit            0
saLogMaxApplicationStreams  64

All the above parameters except saLogRootDirectory has a default value
set in the class definition (see logsv_classes.xml). The value for parameter
saLogRootDirectory is instead defined when the imm.xml file is created. In
the logsv_objects.xml file the parameter value is set to "xxLOGDIRxx/saflog"
and when the imm.xml file is created "xxLOGDIRxx" is replaced by the content of
$pkglogdir. See also LOGSV_ROOT_DIRECTORY in the logd.conf file.

The configuration file is still used to "enable trace" and
"enable info level logging". Also the environment variable
LGSV_ENV_HEALTHCHECK_KEY is used.

2. Configuration using a configuration file with environment variables:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the "old" way of handling configuration and is kept for backwards
compatibility and is used if no IMM configuration object is found .
The config file is typically:

/etc/opensaf/logd.conf

The LOG server start script sources the configuration file before it starts
the LOG server. So any change in this will requires a restart of the LOG
server which implies OpenSAF on that node.

The following environment variable is required:

LOGSV_ROOT_DIRECTORY

This variable is needed to configure the "implementation defined root
directory" as mentioned in the spec. All log files will be stored directly 
in this directory or in a subdirectory. If HA characterisitcs are needed for 
LOG streams, configure this directory to point to replicated (shared & 
persistent) partition.

The following environment variables are optional:

LOGSV_MAX_LOGRECSIZE

The maximum size of a log record. The size must be at least 256 byte.

LOG_STREAM_SYSTEM_HIGH_LIMIT

The high limit for the system/notification streams. Default unlimited. A
reasonable value would be 300 (messages).

LOG_STREAM_SYSTEM_LOW_LIMIT

The low limit for the system/notification streams. Only valid and used if
a high limit has been defined. Defaults to some percent of the high limit
(if not specified).

LOG_STREAM_APP_HIGH_LIMIT

The high limit for all application streams. Default unlimited. A
reasonable value would be 300 (messages).

LOG_STREAM_APP_LOW_LIMIT

The low limit for the all application streams. Only valid and used if
a high limit has been defined. Defaults to some percent of the high limit
(if not specified).

LOG_MAX_APPLICATION_STREAMS

The maximum number of application log streams that can be created.

Don't forget the "export" keyword before the variable!

3. Precedence, special case
---------------------------
If any of the following attributes contains its default value of 0 and a
corresponding environment variable is defined according to 2. the environment
variable will be used.

Config object attribute will be replaced by value of environment variable
saLogStreamSystemHighLimit  0                       LOG_STREAM_SYSTEM_HIGH_LIMIT
saLogStreamSystemLowLimit   0                       LOG_STREAM_SYSTEM_LOW_LIMIT
saLogAppHighLimit           0                       LOG_STREAM_APP_HIGH_LIMIT
saLogAppLowLimit            0                       LOG_STREAM_APP_LOW_LIMIT

The attributes in the configuration object is not changed to reflect this.
The configuration is logged in the syslog (messages)
Example:
...osaflogd[409]: NO Log config sys: hi 50001 lo 5001, app: hi 50002 lo 5002

If an environment variable is defined and the corresponding config object
attribute is not 0 the environment variable will not be used and a warning is
logged.
Example:
...WA Log Configuration object 'logConfig=1,safApp=safLogService' exists
...WA Ignoring environment variable LOG_STREAM_SYSTEM_HIGH_LIMIT


COMMAND LINE INTERFACE

The 'saflogger' command can be used to enter log records to any stream. Please
see the on line help for more information.


DEBUG

Log server traces are by default disabled. To enable/disable log server traces 
in a running system, send signal USR1 to the osaflogd process. Every time the 
trace state is toggled. Example:

	$ pkill -USR2 osaflogd

Traces are written to the file:

	$pkglogdir/osaflogd

To enable traces from the very start of the log server, uncomment the line:

        #args="--tracemask=0xffffffff"

in logd.conf (see CONFIGURATION above) and restart the cluster.

For fatal errors syslog is used.


TEST

Currently a simple unit test can be found in 'tests/logsv/src'. The test suite
is built by the main make system and is either install by 'make install' or by
installing the tools rpm.
