GENERAL
CLMSv is an implementation of the SAF-AIS-CLM-B.04.01 specifications.

This document provides an overview of the design and internals of the CLMSv.
The CLMSv service is implemented as the following modules:
	* CLMS - The Cluster Membership Server
	* CLMNA - The Cluster Membership Node Agent
	* CLMA - The Cluster Membership Agent

The CLMS server is implemented as a server process running on the OpenSAF
controller nodes in a 2N redundancy model.

The CLMNA is an CLM node agent process that gets started on every node during
OpenSAF node startup. The CLMNA fetches the saClmNode(node name)of the local node,
the saClmNodeID(/etc/opensaf/node_id a "run time" attribute) 
of the saClmNode class) and updates the CLMS.
The CLMNA is modelled as component in a NoRedundancy Model with error recovery
as NodeFailFast.

OpenSAF 4.4 provides support for saClmNodeAddressFamily and saClmNodeAddress
attributes when TCP is chosen as the mode of transport.
These attributes shall represent the ipaddress and ipaddressfamily
configured(in dtmd.conf) for a member node when TCP is used for OpenSAF
communication.
NOTES:
- Currently, It shall be the responsibility of the user to 
ensure that they use/configure the 'same ipaddress values' in dtmd.conf and in the imm.xml.
i.e. CLM shall not attempt to validate them in 4.4.

- When user chooses TIPC as mode of transport, then the address length will be
set to 0 and address family shall contain the default value of 
SA_CLM_AF_INET.
This is done for backward compatibility with pre OpenSAF 4.4 libraries
and also because the CLM spec does not support any value other than 
SA_CLM_AF_INET(i.e. for IPv4) and SA_CLM_AF_INET6 
(i.e. for IPv6).

The CLMA is the clm agent library that user applications shall link with.
