WHAT IS THIS?

This directory (and subdirectories) contains a User Mode Linux - UML simulated
cluster environment.

The cluster environment is built using:
- Linux kernel
- Busybox
- a few host libraries

All packages are downloaded from the net. Make sure to have proxy settings
correct if needed. Downloaded packages are stored in the 'archive'
subdirectories.

For minimising the memory requirements for each UML instance, the major part
of its root file system consists of links to files on the host file
system. This concept is called a shadow root, see below.


DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

$ARCHIVE  This directory contains linux and busybox downloads
          (./archive/ used as default).

bin	  This direcory contains the UML binary and a few scripts.

config    This directory contains linux and busybox configuration and
	  patches.

root_template	This directory contains the template for building initramfs 
		which is used as root file system.


HOW TO BUILD

- Execute './build_uml all' in this directory or './build_uml' in the
parent directory.

Building means downloading, configuring & building kernel and busybox packages
from the internet.

Files are downloaded to the directory pointed out by the $ARCHIVE
variable, or to "./archive" if not defined.

Files created are removed by 'clean_uml'. Downloaded files are
removed manually by deleting them from the archive.

Building adds the following direcories:

root	   This directory structure is used when building the initramfs for 
	   the kernel. It is created using the root_template and busybox
	   binary.

linux-*	   This directory contains the extracted linux kernel source package.

busybox-*   This directory contains the extracted busybox source package.

tipcutils-*  This directory contains the extracted tipc utils source package.

uml_utilities_*	This directory contains the extraed UML utilities
		source package.


HOW TO RUN

To start one UML instance in a shell:

   ./bin/linux

For each UML instance started, the PID of the main thread is saved in a PID
file in the user's home directory, i.e. ~/.uml/<xxx>/pid.


HOW TO CONFIGURE A CUSTOM KERNEL VERSION

To generate the kernel configuration file for a different kernel version,
first generate the default configuration file using the following command:

   make ARCH=um defconfig

Then add initramfs and TIPC to the configuration, e.g. using the menuconfig
command:

   make ARCH=um menuconfig


PERFORMANCE


Consider applying the SKAS3 patch to the host.


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

UML should run on any 2.6 host kernel. If the host kernel is patched for SKAS3
mode, you will get better guest (UML) kernel performance.

GNU C Library version 2.4 or later
